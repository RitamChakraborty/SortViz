## SortViz

A flutter project that helps you visualise various sorting algorithms.

### Description

A sorting visualizer that visualises different sorting algorithms on an array of bar graph, as the human brain learns better from visuals, so a person by simply observing the pattern can differentiate between them.

This app runs both as web and mobile application.
